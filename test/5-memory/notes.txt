TEST CASE FILE CONVENTIONS: 

desc prefaces file with a description 
Lower case instructions 
fields separated as follows: addiu $2, $2, 65535 
# for expected final value of v0 , preface with 0x for hex
data N will convert the denary value N into hex for reading into data 
Data 0xN will directly write N 
 Memory: 0-10 is assumed to be data 
11-20 can be used for backwards jumps  
21-30 used for max backwards branch  
31-40 used for max forwards branch  
41-50 used for max jump forwards branch  
ALL other branch/jump within 0xBFC00000 range 



Jumping backwards
jump back to memory location 44
containing:
lw $17, 8($0)
addu $2, $2, $17
jr $0

//maximum of branch is from curr_PC-FFFF8000 to curr_PC+00007FFF
bfbe000c contains addiu $2, $2, 156
Branching backwards to memory location bfbe000c containing
addiu $2, $2, 31
jr $0

//maximum of branch is from curr_PC-FFFF8000 to curr_PC+00007FFF
Branching forwards to memory location bfc20008 containing
